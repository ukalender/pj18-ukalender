## Player Profiling in Football (Python)
I applied k-means clustering algorithm to the football event data which consist of all actions performed with ball at player level. It is observed that there are 4 different forward clusters who have different playing style. Click [here](Player_Profiling_in_Football.html) to review the analysis.

## Football Data Analysis (Python)
You can reach my introductory analysis of football events data from 5 biggest European leagues by [clicking there](Football Data Analysis.html). I used pandas, numpy and matplotlib.pyplot packages through analysis.

## Group Project (R)
We conducted a group project as a part of Data Analytics Essentials course. Primary goal of this analysis is to find & address the specific patterns that shape the migration dynamics in Turkey.
- First, we analyzed the data how the migration figures evolved in four years and then visualized the common patterns observed along this period
- Then we tried to link additional demographic statistics from TUIK and showed that what would be the population density across cities if people could migrate to place where they were born instead of where they migrated actually
