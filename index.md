## Group Project
We conducted a group project as a part of Data Analytics Essential course. Primary goal of this analysis is to find & address the specific patterns that shape the migration dynamics in Turkey.
- First, we analyzed the data how the migration figures evolved in four years and then visualized the common patterns observed along this period
- Then we tried to link additional demographic statistics from TUIK and showed that what would be the population density across cities if people could migrate to place where they were born instead of where they migrated actually
